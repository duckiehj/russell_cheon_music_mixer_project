# Music Mixer Project by Russell and Jin
This repo contains the submission for MMED-1055 Music Mixer project by Russell & Jin.  

This project is an interactive music mixer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to create a custom audio experience by dragging and dropping sound elements, triggering audio playback and visual feedback to build a layered music mix. Inspired by interactive music tools such as Incredibox, the project encourages users to explore sound, rhythm, and composition through intuitive interaction. The focus of the project is on real-time user interaction, audio layering, and clear visual response within a browser-based environment.

The project was developed using a sprint-based workflow with an emphasis on collaboration and experimentation.

Russell is responsible for development, core ideas, and technical research, focusing on JavaScript functionality and audio interactions. Jin handles visual design, design research, and project management, coordinating schedules and ensuring the project stays organized and on track.

Feel free to explore our music mixer and enjoy it.
